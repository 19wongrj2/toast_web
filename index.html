            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
                UofT Toastmasters is a public speaking and leadership development club.
                We cultivate a supportive environment where both beginners and experienced speakers can thrive.
                Founded in 2004 as an engineering student club,
                UofT Toastmasters has since expanded to include both students and professionals.
                Over the years, we've helped hundreds of students grow into incredible speakers and live
                as strong leaders. We want to help you realize your full potential as well!
                Associated with Toastmasters International,
                we invite everyone to join us at our regular meetings as guests or members.

                Hello! I am Ryan and I'm a 4th year student majoring in City Studies and Human Geography in the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. I do all sorts of things such as exploring around Toronto, running and cycling, building cities in Minecraft, and visiting subway stations. Also, I do this thing called Toastmasters on the side, it's fun.
